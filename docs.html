</div></section><section><div class="container"><h2>Normalization Proxy</h2><p>These are the specifications for <a href="https://nlz.io">https://nlz.io</a> as well as any <a href="https://github.com/normalize/proxy.js">normalize-proxy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="url-structure">URL Structure</h3>
<p>URLs generally have the form: <code>https://nlz.io/&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;file&gt;</code>.
Obviously, different proxies will have different hostnames.</p>
<h4 id="protocol">Protocol</h4>
<p>Every proxy <strong>must</strong> serve via HTTPS and SPDY/HTTPv2,
even with a self-signed certificate.</p>
<h4 id="remote">Remote</h4>
<p>A supported remote&#39;s name, for example <code>github/</code>.</p>
<p>Aliases will also be supported and will simply redirect to the canonical short name.
For example, <code>github.com</code> and <code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code> would redirect to <code>github</code>.</p>
<h4 id="user">User</h4>
<p>If the remote does not have a namespace, the user should simply be <code>-</code>.</p>
<h4 id="project">Project</h4>
<p>The name of the project or module.</p>
<h4 id="version">Version</h4>
<p>Any version as defined by <a href="http://semver.org">http://semver.org</a> v2.0.0.
You should not include leading <code>v</code>s and <code>=</code> in single versions</p>
<p>Eventually, commit SHAs for <code>git</code> remotes will be supported.
However, branches will never be supported.</p>
<h3 id="api-end-points">API End Points</h3>
<h4 id="get-file">GET File</h4>
<p>You may still <code>GET</code> files directly, even with transforms.
All of the files dependencies will be SPDY pushed to the client.</p>
<p>Each file can have the following query strings.
These are only valid when <strong>exact</strong>, so don&#39;t include a trailing <code>=</code>.
Only one query string can be used at a time:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>?source</code> - return/redirect the source file and its dependencies all without any transformations applied. Useful for building server-side.</li>
<li><code>?min</code> - minify the transformation. Only applies to JS, CSS, and HTML assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these query strings are included,
then all the pushed dependencies will also include the same query string.</p>
<p>Each file will have an <code>ETag</code> header which is the <code>sha256 sum</code> of the <strong>source</strong> file.
Thus, the only real way to verify whether this header is correct is to check the <code>?source</code> file.
The ETag will remain the same between query strings and differences in transforms</p>
<p>Note that the ETag header is subject to change as this is obviously less than ideal.</p>
<h4 id="get-pull">GET pull</h4>
<pre><code>GET https://nlz.io/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">remote</span>&gt;</span>/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">user</span>&gt;</span>/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">project</span>&gt;</span>/pull
</code></pre><p>This will <code>pull</code> a specific version from the remote if it has not be installed already.
If successful, a <code>204</code> status code will be returned.
You may consider this the optional &quot;publish&quot; step of Normalize.IO.</p>
<h4 id="get-versions-json">GET versions.json</h4>
<pre><code>GET https://nlz.io/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">remote</span>&gt;</span>/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">user</span>&gt;</span>/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">project</span>&gt;</span>/versions.json
</code></pre><p>Will return an array of versions that are currently available on the proxy.
If no versions are installed, then the latest version will automatically be installed.
A <code>404</code> and an empty array will be returned only when the module can not be installed.</p>
<p>If you pushed a new version of a package,
but the proxy has not installed it yet,
simply install it by hitting the <code>pull</code> entry point.</p>
<p>The semantics of this endpoint is subject to change.
In particular, it should return all available versions on the remote.</p>
<h4 id="get-metadata-json">GET metadata.json</h4>
<pre><code>GET https://nlz.io/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">remote</span>&gt;</span>/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">user</span>&gt;</span>/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">project</span>&gt;</span>/metadata.json
</code></pre><p>Per-repository metadata that is not version-specific.
This is where you&#39;ll find metadata such as author, keywords, etc.</p>
<h4 id="get-search-json">GET search.json</h4>
<pre><code>GET https://nlz.io/search.json?<span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>
</code></pre><p>Search the proxy&#39;s installed files and projects.
All search parameters should be passed as query string parameters.
These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>remote</code></li>
<li><code>user</code>/<code>owner</code>/<code>organization</code></li>
<li><code>project</code>/<code>repository</code></li>
<li><code>keywords</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="get-proxy-json">GET proxy.json</h4>
<pre><code class="lang-js">GET https://nlz<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.io</span>/proxy<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.json</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Returns relevant information about the proxy including hostname, version, and supported remotes.</p>
<h3 id="normalization-preference">Normalization Preference</h3>
<p>Packages are &quot;normalized&quot; based on these JSON files in descending priority.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>component.json</code></li>
<li><code>package.json</code></li>
<li><code>bower.json</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This is particularly important if you compile your module for one package manager but not the others.
Thus, if you have to compile your module for a package manager,
compile it for <code>bower</code>.</p>
<h3 id="module-classification">Module Classification</h3>
<p>The normalization proxy is currently designed primarily for web components and modules.
Thus, it needs a way to classify whether a module is web-compatible.
Currently, classification is defined by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.html</code> exists</li>
<li><code>index.css</code> exists</li>
<li><code>component.json</code> exists</li>
<li><code>bower.json</code> exists</li>
<li><p><code>package.json</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.browser</code> exists</li>
<li><code>.style</code> exists</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div></section><section><div class="container"><h2>Transforms</h2><p>These are all the transforms available for both the normalization proxy and <code>nlz-build</code>.
Unlike Component, Browserify, and other build systems,
transforms are included automatically,
and all transforms are stored in a single repository.
There are a couple of reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This middleware system is a more complicated than other middleware systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of Koa-based upstream/downstream is quite complex</li>
<li>Order of middleware is very important, especially when handling upstreams/downstreams</li>
<li>Transforms are not orthogonal to another, so we have to make sure each plugin interacts with each other well.
This is more difficult than creating the transforms themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The purpose of normalization is for everyone to be on the same page.
It&#39;s counter productive to have different semantics for the same transform across applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PRs for additional transforms are welcomed as long as there&#39;s a valid use-case and people would actually use it.</p>
<h3 id="how-transforms-work">How Transforms Work</h3>
<p>Given a source file such as <code>template.html</code>,
the walker transforms the file based on additional <code>.&lt;extensions&gt;</code>.
For example, <code>template.html.js</code> will export the HTML string as a JS string.
This is superior because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s compatible with HTTP servers</li>
<li>The transforms used are explicitly shown</li>
<li>It allows you to use the same source file in multiple ways without configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <code>template.jade.js</code> would return a jade render function whereas <code>template.jade.html.js</code> will return the jade template as a compiled string.</p>
<p>You can also compose multiple transforms together.
For example, <code>.jade.html</code> is its own transform and so is <code>.html.js</code>.
Together, <code>.jade.html.js</code> has a very specific meaning.
In other words, <code>.jade.html.js</code> is a composition of transforms!</p>
<p>Unlike other build systems and package managers,
transforms have the ability to inject required dependencies into your application,
making development easier in general.
For example, to use <code>.jade.js</code>, you need to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/blob/master/runtime/dev.js">jade runtime</a>.
The Jade transform will automatically inject the runtime by compiling your jade template to something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> jade = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'https://nlz.io/github/visionmedia/jade/1/lib/runtime.js'</span>)

module.exports = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">template</span><span class="hljs-params">(locals)</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// compiled jade</span>
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="css-transforms">CSS Transforms</h3>
<h4 id="autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</h4>
<p>All CSS is automatically prefixed using <a href="https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer">autoprefixer</a>.
No extensions are necessary.
The default options are used.</p>
<h4 id="rework">Rework</h4>
<p>A subset of specification compliant <a href="https://github.com/reworkcss/rework">rework</a> plugins are included.
These are essentially a subset of <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/myth">myth</a>.
These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color manipulation via <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-color-function">rework-color-function</a></li>
<li>Math via <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#calc-notation">rework-calc</a></li>
<li>4/8-digit hex color support via <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-hex-alpha">rework-hex-alpha</a></li>
<li>Font-variant shorthands via <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-font-variant">rework-font-variant</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="js-transforms">JS Transforms</h3>
<h4 id="es6-modules">ES6 Modules</h4>
<p>All ES6 modules are automatically transpiled to CommonJS modules using <a href="https://github.com/andreypopp/es6-module-jstransform">es6-module-jstransform</a>.
This will be disabled by default once ES6 modules are widely supported by browsers.</p>
<h4 id="regenerator">Regenerator</h4>
<p>All code that uses generators are automatically transformed using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/regenerator">regenerator</a>.
This will be disabled by default once generators are widely supported by browsers.</p>
<h4 id="-mime-text-js-"><code>.&lt;mime:text/*&gt;.js</code></h4>
<p>All extensions whose corresponding MIME type is <code>text/*</code> are automatically transformed to a JS string using <code>JSON.stringify()</code> unless superceded by another transform.</p>
<p>This is included in <code>normalize-walker</code>.</p>
<h4 id="-json-js-"><code>.json.js</code></h4>
<p>Transforms JSON files to a JS object.</p>
<p>This is included in <code>normalize-walker</code>.</p>
<h3 id="template-transforms">Template Transforms</h3>
<h4 id="-jade-html-"><code>.jade.html</code></h4>
<p>Compile <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/jade">jade</a> templates to an HTML string.</p>
<h4 id="-jade-js-"><code>.jade.js</code></h4>
<p>Compile <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/jade">jade</a> templates to a function.</p>
<h4 id="-md-markdown-html-"><code>.(md|markdown).html</code></h4>
<p>Compile markdown templates to an HTML string using <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">marked</a>.</p>
<h4 id="-jsx-js-"><code>.jsx.js</code></h4>
<p>Compile <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> <code>.jsx</code> templates to JS.</p>
<h4 id="-html-domify-js-"><code>.html.domify.js</code></h4>
<p>Compile an HTML string to an element using <a href="https://github.com/component/domify">domify</a>.
This is useful for web components and templates.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-reserved">var</span> template = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'./template.html.domify.js'</span>)

<span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.body.appendChild(template.cloneNode(<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>))
</code></pre>
</div></section><section><div class="container"><h2>Authoring JavaScript</h2><h3 id="supported-module-systems">Supported Module Systems</h3>
<p>Normalize currently compiles ES6 modules to CommonJS and will do so until all modern browsers support ES6 modules natively.
Thus, Normalize is also able to use CommonJS dependencies.</p>
<p>Normalize does not currently support AMD modules.</p>
</div></section><section><div class="container"><h2>Authoring CSS</h2><h3 id="don-ts">Don&#39;ts</h3>
<h4 id="don-t-do-crazy-imports">Don&#39;t do crazy @imports</h4>
<p>Stick with simple <code>@import</code> statements.
<code>@import</code> statements using <code>url()</code>s and media queries are not supported.</p>
</div></section><section><div class="container"><h2>Production Checklist</h2><p><a href="https://nlz.io">https://nlz.io</a> is <strong>NOT</strong> ready to be used as a CDN in production.
You may still use it as a registry and proxy for <code>nlz(1)</code>,
but serving files from <a href="https://nlz.io">https://nlz.io</a> is not recommended.</p>
<p>The following criteria must be met before it is ready for production usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CDN that supports SPDY Push must be used. We&#39;re not going to setup a complex infrastructure to make this work (like npm).</li>
<li>Browsers must support SPDY</li>
<li>Browsers must support URLs in ES6 module <code>import</code> statements</li>
<li>Browsers must support <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;import&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;</code> tags</li>
</ul>
</div></section><section><div class="container"><h2>Philosophy</h2><p>Normalize.IO was born out of frustration with the current web development workflow.
It has a very specific philosophy,
which will affect its development.</p>
<p>Wondering if Normalize.IO should add a feature?
If it complies with these tenets, then let us know!
Otherwise, don&#39;t bother.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-the-basics">Back to the Basics</h3>
<p>The web development stack should be as short as possible.
This means no unnecessary abstractions or opinions and just use what WC3, WHATWG, and ES has given us.
Things like LESS, CoffeeScript, and Grunt are second-class citizens.
Of course, this was impossible until recently as <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;import&quot;&gt;</code> and <code>import &quot;index.js&quot;</code> were only added recently.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s not try to build the ideal stack of <code>npm + browserify + less + rework-npm + gulp + yeoman</code>, etc.
We should strive towards <strong>no stack</strong> using only features browsers (will) support,
and at most 1 tool, <code>nlz</code> or anything similar, as a stopgap until browsers get us there.</p>
<h3 id="specification-compliant">Specification Compliant</h3>
<p>Normalize.IO will strive to comply with specifications from the web authorities,
particularly ECMAScript, WHATWG, and WC3.
Specifications like CommonJS, AMD, and UMD are completely irrelevant and are only used as stopgaps for the true specifications.</p>
<p>Thus, you may see features such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables">CSS Variables</a> and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/regenerator/">regenerator</a> automatically included, acting like polyfills.
But you will not see features such as <a href="https://github.com/reworkcss/rework-inherit">@extend</a> make it unless they are added to the specifications, even as a draft.</p>
<h3 id="opt-in-everything">Opt-In Everything</h3>
<p>Many build systems such as <code>grunt</code>, <code>gulp</code>, <code>broccoli</code>, <code>browserify</code>, and <code>component</code> have a lot of possible plugins and configuration options.
However, these have become a bane for web development as now users have to install tens of modules just to get their app running
as well as figure out how to configure all these plugins to work with each other with giant configuration scripts.
Developers would also have to write plugins for every time of platform,
creating what I call &quot;module pollution&quot;.</p>
<p>The Normalize.IO philosophy is the opposite - it should include all plugins that 99% of web developers use,
allowing most to be able to just simply <code>nlz build --watch</code> their component or app and call it a day.
Eventually, they should be able to skip <code>nlz</code> and simply <code>open webpage.html</code>.
Bootstrapping apps and components should not be complicated.</p>
<p>This means that Normalize.IO will push out those 1% of developers who want something very specific and most likely outside of specifications.
If this 1% wishes to use Normalize.IO, they would have to essentially create their own proxy and client to do so.
Otherwise, they could use the many other build tools at their disposal.</p>
<h3 id="normalize-web-development">Normalize Web Development</h3>
<p>Aside from the top three tenets,
the idea behind Normalize.IO is to &quot;normalize&quot; or &quot;standardize&quot; web development.
We want to keep features specification compliant and (cognitive) overhead minimal.</p>
<p>But of course, this means normalizing and standardizing how apps and components are built and structured.
This is the primary concept behind <code>entrypoints</code> such as <code>index.js</code>, <code>test.js</code>, <code>README</code>, etc.
People should know what to expect from a &quot;normal&quot; app/module/component.</p>
<h3 id="1-to-1-transformations">1-to-1 Transformations</h3>
<p>One of the most complicated type of transform are many-to-1 transforms.
For example, concatenating all your SCSS files, then converting it to a single CSS file.
However there are many wrong with this philosophy.</p>
<p>Normalize.IO will only support 1-to-1 transformations except for a few cases,
with caveats, such as CSS Variables, since it is specification-compliant.</p>
<h4 id="file-interdependence">File Interdependence</h4>
<p>The only dependencies files should have upon each other are those defined by specifications such as <code>@import</code>.
Anything else is too opinionated for Normalize.IO.
With CSS preprocessors, this may be necessary when using mixins, variables, etc.,
but you should instead strive towards specifications such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables">CSS Variables</a>.</p>
<h4 id="no-incremental-builds">No Incremental Builds</h4>
<p>Only supporting 1-to-1 transformations allow very fast build times through incremental builds.
<code>nlz</code> uses <code>make</code>-like 1-to-1 transforms and only rebuilds what has changed.
When you have many-to-one transforms, 1 line change would require a full rebuild.
The difference is a <code>x * 100ms</code> vs. <code>&lt; 100ms</code> build times,
especially with CSS preprocessors such as Stylus and SASS.</p>
<h4 id="no-complicated-build-process">No Complicated Build Process</h4>
<p>Many build tools such as <code>grunt</code>, <code>gulp</code>, and <code>broccoli</code> were created out of a need to support these types of transforms.
In the end, you create very complex build processes and configuration options,
all of which is unnecessary and not specification-compliant.</p>
